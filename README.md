Angular.js Radial Plot Directive
================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GordyD/angular-radial-plot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GordyD/angular-radial-plot)

I think radar graphs are cool. I also think Angular.js and d3.js are cool, so I decided to create an Angular.js directive for creating customisable radial plots... and *BLAM*, here it is!

You can see a demo of the current feature set [here](http://gordyd.github.io/).

I welcome any contributions. Please feel free to fork and improve.

Setup Examples
--------------

Clone the repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GordyD/radialplot.git
cd angular-radial-plot`.
npm install
bower install
npm test
node app.js
```
Go to `http://localhost:3000/example.html` to see example radial plots.

Usage
-----

In order to use in your project you will need to:

1. include `radialplot.js` as one of your source files e.g `<script src="src/radialplot.js">`
2. include `radialplot.css` for styling
3. include `ui.radialplot` as a dependency of your Angular app e.g. `var app = angular.module('radialPlotExampleApp', ['ui.radialplot']);`

Features
--------
- Plot a 1-n dimension radial plot
- Labelling 
- Linear or logarithic scaling
- Interactive - can be used as an input device
- Linear or cardinal close interpolation of lines
- Overlay comparison plot on graph
- Animate between different sets of values
- Styleable
- Works well on Mobile (moved from having to click directly on points to click in region of axis)

Planned Improvements (Dec 2014)
-------------------------------
- Stackable plotting of data
